The importance of fast language models can be seen in the following aspects:\n","\n","1. **Real-time Applications**: Fast language models enable real-time applications such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots to respond promptly to user input. This is essential for applications that require immediate feedback, such as customer service chatbots or real-time language translation.\n","2. **Large-Scale Data Processing**: Fast language models can handle large volumes of text data, making them ideal for applications that involve processing massive amounts of text, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and information retrieval.\n","3. **Low-Latency Requirements**: Fast language models are essential for applications that require low-latency responses, such as voice assistants, virtual assistants, and real-time dialogue systems. These models can process user input quickly, providing immediate responses and enhancing the overall user experience.\n","4. **Resource-Constrained Devices**: Fast language models are crucial for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as mobile devices, smart home devices, and edge devices. These models can operate efficiently on devices with limited computational resources, enabling the deployment of NLP applications in a wide range of scenarios.\n","5. **Improved User Experience**: Fast language models can significantly improve the user experience by providing rapid responses to user input, reducing wait times, and enabling more interactive and engaging applications.\n","6. **Enhanced Productivity**: Fast language models can automate tasks such as text summarization, document classification, and language translation, freeing up human resources for more strategic and creative tasks.\n","7. **Competitive Advantage**: Organizations that deploy fast language models can gain a competitive advantage by providing faster and more efficient services, improving customer satisfaction, and reducing operational costs.\n","\n","To achieve fast language models, researchers and developers employ various techniques, including:\n","\n","1. **Model Pruning**: Reducing the size of the model by removing unnecessary parameters and connections.\n","2. **Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring knowledge from a large, complex model to a smaller, faster model.\n","3. **Quantization**: Reducing the precision of model weights and activations to reduce computational requirements.\n","4. **Parallelization**: Distributing model computations across multiple processing units or devices.\n","5. **Efficient Algorithms**: Developing algorithms that minimize computational requirements, such as attention-based models and transformer architectures.\n","\n","In summary, fast language models are essential for a wide range of NLP applications, enabling real-time processing, large-scale data analysis, and low-latency responses. By employing various techniques to optimize model performance, developers can create fast and efficient language models that improve user experience, enhance productivity, and provide a competitive advantage.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Agent:\n","    def __init__(self, client, system):\n","        self.client = client\n","        self.system = system\n","        self.messages = []\n","        if self.system is not None:\n","            self.messages.append({\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": self.system})\n","\n","    def __call__(self, message=\"\"):\n","        if message:\n","            self.messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": message})\n","        result = self.execute()\n","        # Ensure result is never empty\n","        result = result if result.strip() else \"[No response generated]\"\n","        self.messages.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": result})\n","        return result\n","\n","    def execute(self):\n","        completion = self.client.chat.completions.create(\n","           messages=self.messages,\n","           model=\"llama-3.3-70b-versatile\",\n","        )\n","        return completion.choices[0].message.content"],"metadata":{"id":"a-CMQcaen8Bg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747606854436,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":43,"user":{"displayName":"Leonardo Alfaro","userId":"11816296464637757843"}}},"execution_count":39,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["system_prompt = \"\"\"\n","You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Pause, Observation.\n","At the end of the loop you output an Answer\n","Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question tou have been ascked.\n","Use Action to tun one of the actions available to you -
